# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Deep Learning (CNN)

## Project Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) poses a significant global health challenge, often leading to irreversible blindness if undetected. This project addresses the critical need for early and accurate DR diagnosis by developing an advanced deep learning framework. My primary objective is to accurately classify retinal images to identify the presence of diabetic retinopathy, distinguishing it from healthy ocular states.

Leveraging a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model within a PyTorch framework, this interactive web application showcases the architectural design, experimental methodology, and performance outcomes. The robust experimental results presented herein underscore the efficacy of my deep learning approach in real-world diagnostic scenarios.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **Kaggle "Diabetic Retinopathy Detection" dataset**. This extensive dataset comprises a large collection of high-resolution retinal images, meticulously labeled for the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy. It serves as a robust foundation for training and evaluating deep learning models for DR classification.

## Training Process

My training methodology involved a carefully constructed pipeline to ensure optimal model performance. The key stages are outlined below, incorporating insights from established literature benchmarks.

### Training Pipeline

*   **Dataset**: Kaggle “APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection” dataset (~5,592 images; 3,663 for training, 1,929 for testing)  
*   **Preprocessing**: Contrast enhancement (CLAHE), normalization, image resizing to typical CNN input size (224×224 or 256×256), image augmentation (flips, rotations, brightness/contrast adjustments)  
*   **Architecture**: Custom CNN or lesion-aware model trained from scratch or via transfer learning (e.g., Inception, EfficientNet) with hyperparameters: Adam optimizer, batch size ~32–64, epochs ~30–50, early stopping based on validation loss.
